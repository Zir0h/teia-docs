## Update Documentation in the Teia Docs Repository

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to update a documentation file stored in the /wiki folder of this GitHub repository. The process involves navigating to the file, accessing the editing interface, and making changes using the built-in Markdown editor.

Note that formerly files were stored in the wiki repo of this, the Teia Docs repository, but they have now been moved to the /wiki folder.  When you edit a file in the /wiki folder on the main branch, a GitHub action will be triggered and that file will be pushed to the internal GitHub wiki repo.  Likewise when any update is made using the GitHub wiki interface, that changed will be synced back to the /wiki folder.  This is only temporary until we have decied on another publishing workflow for our documentation using a tool like Docusaurus or Tinacms.

Eventually this documentation, this page you are reading now, describing how to update the
documentation, will be stored in the GitHub wiki for this repo, the Teia Docs
repo. Along with maybe a few other pages which explain what the Teia Docs repo
is for, how to update the documentation, and how to manage the documentation tools we decide to use.

## For Teia Organization members

For members of the Teia Community organization, you can now go to the Teia Docs
code repository and find the /wiki folder mentioned above.  You will see
a listing of .md files.  Click on the file name of any of those files and you
will be taking to a markdown editing interface for that page.

## For any GitHub user

If you are not a member of the Teia Organization but you wish to contribute
a documentation update, the process is similar but you must first fork the Teia
Docs repository.

Once you have your own fork, proceed to make the changes or updates you wish to
make then commit your changes to your fork and issue a Pull Request.
